| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| Closed-loop recycling | The process where the waste or by-product from one industry is used as input for another. |
| Cleaner production | Current preventive environmental activities that could play a role in the implementation of industrial ecology. |
| Design for environment | A level of industrial ecology that includes pollution prevention, eco-efficiency, and green accounting. |
| Dematerialisation and decarbonisation | A level of industrial ecology that operates at the regional/global level. |
| Eco-Industrial Park (EIP) | Companies included in an EIP can be viewed as different organisms in a food chain engaging in exchanges of material and energy. |
| Industrial development | The balance of industrial development with the sustainable use of natural resources including energy, materials, and the |capacity of the environment to assimilate wastes and render valuable services. |
| Industrial Ecology (IE) | A novel approach to the production of consumer goods, the design of industrial processes, and the definition of corporate strategies aimed at achieving sustainable development. |
| Industrial ecosystem | A system where the consumption of energy and materials is optimized, waste generation is minimized, and the effluents of one process serve as the raw material for another process. |
| Industrial ecosystems | The concept that promotes solutions aimed at improving the industry’s environmental impact. |
| Industrial metabolism | A level of industrial ecology that includes budgets and cycles, as well as materials and energy flow studies. |
| Industrial symbiosis | The highly inter-dependent relationship between diversified clusters of firms for exchanging materials, energy, water, and |by-products in a mutually advantageous manner. |
| Industrial symbiosis collaboration | A primordial feature of an industrial symbiosis is the collaboration offered by the geographic proximity of the |several companies. |
| Industrial system | A system that operates in concert with rather than isolated from surrounding ecosystems, with the aim of optimizing the material |flows and cycles. |
| Industrial ecology perspectives | Perspectives that can help to optimize industrial systems for energy generation, transfer, or transformation. |
| Industrial ecology system’s theory | A well-known concept in ecology that is closely related to industrial ecosystems. |
| Industrial ecology's core objectives | The focus on whether cleaner production in its present form is sufficient, in terms of breadth of both |industrial activities (sources) and environmental concerns (impacts addressed). |
| Life cycle analysis | A level of industrial ecology that involves industrial symbiosis, and industrial sector initiatives. |
| Reuse, remanufacture, and recycling | Practices that represent a move towards closed-loop material and energy use. |
| Roundput | The idea that the effluents of a company become the input of another to minimize virgin input. |
| Science of sustainability | A succinct and oft-cited idea that industrial ecology is the science of sustainability. |
