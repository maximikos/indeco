A brief history of the field of industrial ecology.

Industrial ecology, as a field, emerged in the 1970s and gained traction in the 1990s with the acceptance of various resource-sharing and waste-sharing schemes among companies and organizations (Wahrlich \& Simioni, 2019). The field is often defined as the "science of sustainability" (Cockerill, 2013) and is seen as a young discipline that considers industrial and commercial enterprises as an ecosystem analogous to biological ecosystems (Cockerill, 2013). The main organizing principle of industrial ecology is that industrial systems should emulate the best features of biological ecosystems, thereby reducing energy and material consumption and waste generation (Cockerill, 2013).

Industrial ecology promotes the concept of an industrial system that operates in concert with rather than isolated from surrounding ecosystems, with the aim of optimizing the material flows and cycles (Wahrlich \& Simioni, 2019). It focuses on the role of industry in reducing environmental burdens throughout the product life cycle from the extraction of raw materials, to the production of goods, to the use of those goods, and to the management of the resulting wastes (Lifset, 1997).

The field of industrial ecology is closely connected to the history of ecological economics, socio-economic metabolism, and the concepts of tragedy of the commons, spaceship earth, and gaia hypothesis. Ecological economics, like industrial ecology, is concerned with the relationship between human actions and the natural world. Socio-economic metabolism is a concept that describes the flow of energy and materials within a society, which is a key focus of industrial ecology. The tragedy of the commons, spaceship earth, and gaia hypothesis are all concepts that highlight the interconnectedness of human activities and the environment, and the need for sustainable practices, which are central to the field of industrial ecology.

Industrial ecology is highly relevant today due to its potential to address the pressing environmental challenges we face. It is an emerging field that views industrial systems as part of a larger ecological whole, aiming to reduce energy and material consumption and waste generation (Gallopoulos, 2006). Here are some reasons why industrial ecology is significant today:

1. Sustainability: Industrial ecology is often referred to as the "science of sustainability" (Graedel \& Allenby, 1995). It promotes the sustainable use of natural resources, balancing industrial development with environmental preservation (van Berkel, Willems, \& Lafleur, 1997).

2. Efficiency: Industrial ecology promotes the efficient use of resources, mimicking the workings of natural ecosystems (Frosch & Gallopoulos, 1989). It encourages the closure of material and energy loops, moving society away from unsustainable linear throughput (Ehrenfeld \& Gertler, 1997).

3. Environmental Impact Reduction: Industrial ecology aims to substantially reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing processes and the use and disposal of products (Laudwe \& Taylor-Smith, 1998). It focuses on the role of industry in reducing environmental burdens throughout the product life cycle (Lifset, 1997).

4. Industrial Symbiosis: Industrial ecology promotes the concept of industrial symbiosis, where industries share resources and waste, creating a new perspective in industrial development (Wahrlich \& Simioni, 2019).

5. Climate Change Adaptation: Industrial ecology can contribute to sustainable climate change adaptation by facilitating international cooperation and providing guidance for concrete solutions (Yang et al., 2020).
