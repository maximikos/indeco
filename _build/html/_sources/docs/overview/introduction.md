Industrial Ecology (IE) is an emerging field that views industrial and commercial enterprises as an ecosystem analogous to biological ecosystems. It is often referred to as the "science of sustainability" (Graedel and Allenby, 1995). The organizing principle of IE is that industrial systems should emulate the best features of biological ecosystems, thereby reducing energy and material consumption and waste generation (Gallopoulos, 2006).

IE takes a systems view of industrial activity, particularly focusing on design and manufacturing processes. The primary goal is to eliminate or substantially reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing processes and the use and disposal of products. This is achieved by implementing pollution prevention technology and strategies that "do it right the first time" (Laudwe and Taylor-Smith, 1998). The system's view is maintained in all major research methods employed in IE. A brief overview of these methods is provided in the below tabs, more detail can be found here.

````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} LCA
> Lifecycle assessment (LCA) is a methodology under the framework of industrial ecology that systematically examines the environmental impacts of a product or service throughout its entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal (Yang et al., 2020). It aims to identify key environmental "hot spots" of a process and provide insights for potential improvement (Wells \& Orsato, 2005).
```

```{tab-item} MFA
> Material flow analysis (MFA) is another tool used in industrial ecology to track the flow of materials within a system, such as an industrial sector or an entire economy (Yang et al., 2020). It helps in understanding the patterns of resource use and waste generation, thereby informing strategies for resource conservation and waste reduction (Wells \& Orsato, 2005).
```

```{tab-item} EE-IO
> Environmentally-extended input-output analysis (EE-IO) is a technique that combines economic data with environmental data to assess the environmental impacts associated with economic activities (Yang et al., 2020). It provides a comprehensive view of the interdependencies between different sectors and regions, contributing to a better understanding of the global economy and its environmental implications (Yang et al., 2020).

IE is "ecological" in that it places human activity, particularly industry, in the larger context of the biophysical environment from which we obtain resources and into which we place our wastes. It focuses on the role of industry in reducing environmental burdens throughout the product life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials, to the production of goods, to the use of those goods, and to the management of the resulting wastes (Lifset, 1997).

IE promotes the concept of an industrial system that operates in concert with rather than isolated from surrounding ecosystems, with the aim of optimizing the material flows and cycles (Wahrlich and Simioni, 2019). It can operate on any of three levels: the facility level, the inter-firm level, and the regional or global level.

The relevance of IE lies in its potential to contribute to sustainable development by closing materials cycles and realizing a fundamental paradigm shift in the thinking concerning industry-ecology relations (den Hond, 2000). It provides principles and tools that can foster change toward a more sustainable society (Journal of Industrial Ecology, 2005).
